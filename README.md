# Sunni (Remake)
Remake of my first game. The main aim is making the code way tidier and more workable, meaning it should be easy to add more levels/features to the game.

To play the game, run `main.py` after installing python 3.6+ and pygame (can install from pygame `requirements.txt` with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`).
